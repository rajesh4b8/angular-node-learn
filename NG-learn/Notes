how angular doing 2-way data-binding ?


NG life-cycle

compilation-phase:

   for every model-property/expressions,
   angular will create 'watcher(s)/listeners'

   watchers read/write model when it is dirty from either side.

   when/how watchers will execute ?

   digest-loop will execute all watcher(s) when model is dirty.

   we can aslo register 'custom-watcher' if required.
