 
   Angular-  scope
   ================
   
   --> is an object that refers to the application model  ( ViewModel )
   --> is an execution context for expressions e.g {{product.name}}
   --> Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure
       ( which mimic the DOM structure of the application)
   --> Scopes can  watch expressions and propagate events.	   
  


  JEE

  servlet ( controller )                     JSP ( view )

  request.setAttribute('product',product);   ${product.name}


  NG

  controller                                HTML-template

  $scope.product=product                    {{product.name}}
   

   
   Scope characteristics
   ---------------------
      
   --> Nested scopes are either 
       "child scopes" or "isolated scopes"
   --> A "child scope" (prototypically) 
       inherits properties from its parent scope if they dont have property
   --> An "isolate scope" does not
   
   
   Scope as Data-Model
   ----------------------
   
   -> Scope is the glue between application controller
      and the view.
      
      Controller  -  $scope   -      View
      
     
	  
	Scope Hierarchies
	-----------------
	
	Each Angular application has exactly one root-scope,
	but may have several child scopes.
